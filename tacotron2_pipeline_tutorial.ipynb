        "The `torch.manual_seed()` function in PyTorch is used to set the seed for generating random numbers. This is crucial for ensuring reproducibility in experiments, particularly in machine learning and deep learning contexts. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "When you call `torch.manual_seed(seed)`, it initializes the random number generator with a fixed seed value. This means that every time you run your code with the same seed, you will get the same sequence of random numbers. This is particularly important for operations that involve randomness, such as initializing weights in neural networks, shuffling data, or sampling from distributions. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import torch\n",
        "\n",
        "torch.manual_seed(42)\n",
        "print(torch.rand(2))  # This will always output the same numbers when the seed is 42\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Impact on Reproducibility\n",
        "\n",
        "Setting a manual seed allows for consistent results across different runs of the code, which is essential for debugging and comparing model performance. Without a fixed seed, the random numbers generated can vary with each execution, leading to different outcomes even with the same input data and model configuration[1][4].\n",
        "\n",
        "### Usage with CUDA\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are using GPU acceleration, it's also recommended to set the seed for CUDA operations using `torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)`. However, as of recent versions of PyTorch, calling `torch.manual_seed(seed)` automatically sets the seed for both CPU and GPU operations, simplifying the process[2][4].\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, `torch.manual_seed()` is a vital tool for ensuring that experiments in PyTorch are reproducible by controlling the randomness in the computations. It should be used at the beginning of your script before any random operations are performed."
